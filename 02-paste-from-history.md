Copy several different words in this file. Then invoke `Paste from history` and paste the copied words below.

Once the dialog is open, you can use the mouse, the keyboard arrows and Enter, or you can also hit a number on your keyboard and this will insert the item with that slot. Just keep in mind that with every paste this gets reordered (the most recent paste goes to slot 1).

> A tricky thing about this is that you sometimes forget it only works in Phpstorm, copy several things e.g. from the browser and then wonder why they don't show up in the Paste from history dialog xD
