To not lose orientation in your terminal's output, you can use the `Clear terminal` action (it is present in the double shift menu, but invoking it like that didn't work for me, I needed to have a shortcut defined).

On the Mac, Cmd+K works for me not only in JetBrains terminal, but in the system-level one as well - give it a try!

It is a bit different from the `$ clear` bash command - in some shells, the `$ clear` command just generates a blank page and you can still scroll up to the previous output. The Cmd+K really deletes the previous output (which you might not like in some situations).
