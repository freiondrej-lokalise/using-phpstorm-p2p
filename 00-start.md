# Welcome!

Many years ago, my life changed thanks to a video about how to use Phpstorm. Since then, not only I started using the suggestions from the video, but more importantly, the video **changed my mindset**. 

**Today, I hope to do something similar for you.**

It is true that changing a habit is difficult and uncomfortable. Also, for some time, it can decrease your efficiency because your focus is distracted by having to do something differently and to think about it consciously. However, in my experience this is not as painful as it sounds and the efficiency gain is substantial. It is similar to improving 1% every day - cumulatively, the small changes make big impact.

# Note

Throughout this repository, I'm not mentioning any keyboard shortcuts. Instead, I am mentioning the name of the action formatted `like this`, so that you can find the action in Settings > Keymap and configure your own keyboard shortcut.
You can just hit double Shift and type the name of the action, that works too :) 

I recommend thinking about your own context and choosing your own shortcuts instead of relying on the prebuilt ones - you might like them, but I did not and I much prefer mine.

I can recommend plugin Key Promoter X, it shows you which actions you do repeatedly and reminds you to create a shortcut for them.
